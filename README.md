# Simple Python Port Scanner

This is my first script written in Python. It's a basic port scanner that checks open TCP ports on a given host.

ðŸš§ **Note:**  
This is a beginner-level project. It currently supports basic scanning but will be improved over time with features like:

- Multithreading
- Banner grabbing
- IP range scanning
- Output reports

ðŸŽ¯ **Goal:**  
Learn more about networking, socket programming, and Python scripting by building this tool step-by-step.
